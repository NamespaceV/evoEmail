challange: design really bad UX app for entering an e-mail adress

This app tries to do UI for genetically breeding strings, so that you can evolve intended emial adress from them.

Latest version is pretty easy to work around.

Just evolve letters you need as 1 character strings, then glue them together...

Needs more work to be even more horrible UX :>
